Passionate about technology and challenges.

I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering at PUC to expand my knowledge. Throughout my professional journey, I have gained experience with several programming languages, mainly Python, Java, and their frameworks Flask, Pyramid, and Spring, respectively.

Main tools I have worked with:
</br>
- Java â€“ Spring</br>
- Python â€“ Flask and Pyramid</br>
- Jenkins</br>
- Git, Github, and Gitlab</br>
- Software testing with Junit, Mockito, and Pytest</br>
- Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)</br>
- Kubernets (EKS)</br>
- AWS</br>
- Agile Methodologies with Scrum and Kanban</br>

During my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various complex projects, delivering high-quality software with a high level of usability, scalability, and performance. I constantly seek challenges and learning opportunities to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and technologies.
